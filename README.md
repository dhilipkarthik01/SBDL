# Real-Time Bank Data Processing with PySpark and Kafka

## Overview

In today's fast-paced world, data is not just valuable—it’s transformative. This project takes real-time bank data and turns it into a finely tuned, structured, and meaningful stream of information, ready for downstream consumption. By leveraging the power of PySpark, Apache Hive, and Kafka, we’ve built a pipeline that processes raw, unstructured bank data into actionable insights, enabling faster decision-making and smarter business processes.

## Key Features & Transformations

### 1. **Data Unification**  
We start by ingesting complex data from multiple sources—bank accounts, party relationships, and addresses—stored in Hive tables and CSV files. Through PySpark, we seamlessly load and harmonize this data, ensuring it’s in a unified format for processing.

### 2. **Schema Optimization**  
We transform and restructure dependent columns into a more efficient and intuitive format by converting them into structured types. This restructuring process combines related fields, such as account details and party addresses, into nested data structures, improving the scalability and query performance.

### 3. **Data Enrichment & Linking**  
Using sophisticated join operations, we bring together the various datasets—linking bank accounts with party information and their addresses. This creates a rich, consolidated view of each account's details and relationships, offering deeper insights into the data.

### 4. **Real-time Stream Processing with Kafka**  
The enriched data is then transformed into JSON format, which is both human-readable and machine-consumable. From there, the data is streamed to Kafka, empowering real-time analytics, monitoring, and decision-making. With Kafka, we ensure that the data can be consumed by downstream systems in real-time, enhancing overall operational efficiency.

### 5. **End-to-End Automation**  
From data ingestion to transformation, and finally to real-time streaming, the entire pipeline is automated. This guarantees that our system is always up-to-date, allowing business teams to make informed decisions with the most current information available.

## Technologies Used

- **PySpark**: For large-scale data processing, transformation, and integration.
- **Hive**: To store and query structured data.
- **Kafka**: For real-time data streaming, ensuring efficient data consumption.
- **JSON**: For flexible and efficient data serialization.

## Impact

This solution is a game-changer in the way financial institutions can process and react to their data. By transforming raw, disparate data into real-time insights, we are enabling banks to better understand customer relationships, improve their operational efficiency, and make smarter, more informed decisions. The project not only enhances data quality but also ensures it’s instantly available for downstream applications that drive business innovation.
